# Analyzing The Effects of COVID-19 locally (Virginia)


The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) is providing a detailed, near real-time health data regarding COVID-19. This dataset is for public use and it could be found [here](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/).The datasets used in this project includes the cumulative (total) number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for each health district in Virginia by report date, age group, and race & ethnicity. 


**My goal is to use my data mining skills to explore the data, visualize it, and find insights that could help better allocate the state resources.**

I am interested in answering the following questions: 
-	Which districts show the highest Hospitalization rate?  
-	What Age group is most affected by COVID-19?
-	Which ethnicity group are most affected by COVID-19? (hospitalization rate and fatality rate)


### Discussion & Conclusion 

The analysis show that Fairfax the highest average number of hospitalization due to COVID-19, twice as much as Prince William which came in second. This piece of information is crucial when allocating resources to hospitals. For example, hospital beds, PPE, staff etc.  On average, individuals above the age of 80 are less likely to survive COVID-19 compared to individuals from a younger age group. People between the age of 60 to 69 show higher hospitalization average than all of the other groups. However, they show better recovery than individuals from older age groups. Extra precautions are needed to protect the senior residence in Virginia, especially places with higher population of elders i.e. nursing homes. Caucasians show higher averages of cases, hospitalization, and fatality than any other ethnic group in Virginia. Further investigative work is needed to analyze the effects of features such as medical history, family history, income, and taking precatory measures (wearing a mask, quarantine, social distancing, etc.). With that being said, this project is a good starting point for future projects.
